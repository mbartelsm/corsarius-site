Well, this is my blog now. If I stick to it, the idea is to use this space to write the things for which I don't have enough characters in Bluesky. It'll hopefully also help with my anxiety with regards to engagement, since I don't track that here.

I hope to use this place as a sort of journal, where I write about myself and my thoughts and my identity. The things that bother me and the things that I enjoy. The things that confuse me and the things I believe.
